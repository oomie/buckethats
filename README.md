Bucket Hats!™ 
My partner Eva and I made a bucket hat commercial for our 30MFF! So, I decided to make an online store as my website! I tried to create a brand, and even designed a few products!! It was really fun making the logo and the products :]

My initial plan was to make 4 main pages for my site : the homepage, shop, about section and customs. Customs was meant to have bucket hat maker, similar to an avatar maker in my mind, where you can pic different colors and designs, but I decided to scrap the customs page for community, which features social media links & posts of 'customers' praising our products!! When you put your mouse over the bucket hats in my shop, or on the photos of Eva and I in about, the photos change! That was my 'interactive' element.

I'm satisfied with how the final project turned out! I'm happy with the color scheme, layout and the overall look! I would've liked to add a favicon and a bucket hat bag product (like in the video) , but i didn't have time :( Overall I'm very proud of the working final version of my Bucket Hats!™ site!
